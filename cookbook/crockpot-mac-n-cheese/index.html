<li>1 pound ground beef or ground turkey <span class="notes">-&gt; <strong>I oven baked broccoli and mixed it into the mac n cheese for the last 30 minutes of cooking</strong></span></li>
<li>2 cups uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
<li>2 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
<li>1 can (14.5 ounces) diced tomatoes</li>
<li>1 can (10.75 ounces) condensed cheddar cheese soup</li>
<li>1 can (12 ounces) evaporated milk <span class="notes">-&gt; <strong>this is wrong, use condensed</strong></span></li>
<li><strong>a couple of drops of liquid smoke</strong></li>
<li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>1 teaspoon paprika <span class="notes">-&gt; <strong>I seasoned by hand and guessed, but it was much more than this</strong></span></li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper <span class="notes">-&gt; <strong>I seasoned by hand and guessed, but it was much more than this</strong></span></li>
<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>Chopped fresh parsley for garnish <span class="notes">-&gt; <strong>this isn't real</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<h2>instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Brown the ground beef or ground turkey in a skillet over medium heat. Drain any excess fat and set aside.</li>
<li>In the crockpot, combine the cooked meat, uncooked elbow macaroni, shredded cheddar cheese, diced tomatoes, cheddar cheese soup, evaporated milk, liquid smoke, chopped onion, minced garlic, paprika, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper.</li>
<li>Stir well to combine all the ingredients.</li>
<li>Cover and cook on low for 2-3 hours, or until the macaroni is tender and the cheese is melted. <span class="notes">-&gt; <strong>this is wrong, it will take at least 3-5 hours to finish cooking the onion</strong></span></li>
<li>Stir the mixture occasionally during the cooking process to ensure even cooking and to prevent the macaroni from sticking to the sides.</li>
<li>Once the macaroni is tender and the cheese is melted, garnish with chopped fresh parsley before serving.</li>
</ol>
