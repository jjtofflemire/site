# jtof.dev/cookbook
- I store all of my recipes in obsidian, in a standard markdown format
- I convert all my recipes to `html` pages with all the custom formatting using `src/main.rs`
  - this script can be called with `cargo run` from the `cookbook/` folder
  - this script also gets automatically called using `git hook`'s
